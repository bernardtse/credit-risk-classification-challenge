## 1. Overview

This challenge uses various techniques to train and evaluate a supervised machine learning model based on loan risk. A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company is used to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.


## 2. Repository, Setup and Execution

### This repository contains:
- [`credit_risk/credit_risk_classification.ipynb`](credit_risk/credit_risk_classification.ipynb) - A Jupyter notebook that contains all the necessary codes
- [`credit_risk/resources/`](credit_risk/resources) - Folder containing the data files used
- `REPORT.md`

### To start: 
- Clone this GitHub repository to a local folder.
- Run credit_risk/credit_risk_classification.ipynb on Jupyter notebook.
- Report is stored in [`REPORT.md`](REPORT.md)

### Required Python Libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- pathlib
- imblearn
